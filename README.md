# Comparative-Analysis-of-Image-Segmentation-Techniques
This GitHub repository hosts a Python project titled "Comparative Analysis of 
Image Segmentation Techniques" which showcases and compares the effectiveness 
of Otsu's Thresholding and Adaptive Thresholding in image segmentation.


Replace the "path_to_img" variable with the path to your image
and run the script to see both segmentation methods in action.
The script will display the original image, the results of each 
segmentation technique, and the time taken for each method.
